title: About
---

I live in Washington, DC and work in the field of science education as a researcher, developer, writer, and editor, focusing on K-12 biology curriculum and assessment. I also enjoy writing about a wide range of topics for broader audiences. Even more than breaking research news, Iâ€™m interested in the intersections of science and other fields like education, communication, policy, art, technology, history, and philosophy.

I recently started a new position as a Project Editor at the Smithsonian Science Education Center ([SSEC](http://www.ssec.si.edu/)). Before that, I was a Research Associate at the American Association for the Advancement of Science ([AAAS](http://www.aaas.org)) Project 2061, where I spent nearly five years contributing to research in science education. I also founded and have been a regular contributor to the team blog [Sci-Ed](http://blogs.plos.org/scied) on the Public Library of Science (PLOS) blog network. I occasionally get time to take some [photos](http://jeancflanagan.com/photos).

## About this site
This site serves as my online portfolio and includes an archive of my writing from around the web. I include my self-published writing here along with articles that have appeared elsewhere. 

The site is the result of a collaboration with my partner, [Oliver Pattison](http://oliverpattison.org), who worked on design and development. It runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. A minimalist, responsive, content-first design philosophy guided the project. (It should work equally well on phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops of various sizes!) Check out Oliver's [website](http://oliverpattison.org) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/opattison/jeancflanagan) for more on the development process.
