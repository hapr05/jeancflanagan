title: About
---

I work in the field of science education as a researcher, developer, writer, and editor, focusing on K-12 biology curriculum materials and assessments. I also enjoy writing about a wide range of topics for broader audiences. I’m especially interested in the intersections of science and other fields like education, policy, art, technology, history, and philosophy.

I’m currently a Project Editor in Curriculum and Communication at the Smithsonian Science Education Center ([SSEC](http://www.ssec.si.edu/)). Before that, I was a Research Associate at the American Association for the Advancement of Science ([AAAS](http://www.aaas.org)) Project 2061, where I spent about five years contributing to research in science education. I also founded and wrote for the team blog [Sci-Ed](http://blogs.plos.org/scied) on the Public Library of Science (PLOS) blog network. 

## Photography 

I occasionally get time to take some [photos](http://jeancflanagan.com/photos).  I started learning on a [Nikon D3000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D3000) DSLR in 2010. My main camera is now a [Fujifilm X-E2](http://www.fujifilmusa.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_e2/) (mirrorless) with a [35mm prime lens](http://www.fujifilmusa.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf35mmf14_r/).  I also have a [Fujifilm HS20 EXR](http://www.fujifilm.com/support/digital_cameras/specifications/s/finepix_hs20exr/) super-zoom, which is handy for occasional wildlife shots. I use Adobe Lightroom for processing.

## About this site
This site serves as my online portfolio and includes an archive of my writing from around the web. I include my self-published writing here along with articles that have appeared elsewhere. 

The site is the result of a collaboration with my partner, [Oliver Pattison](http://oliverpattison.org), who was responsible for its design and development. It runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. A minimalist, responsive, content-first design philosophy guided the project. (It should work equally well on phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops of various sizes!) Check out Oliver's [website](http://oliverpattison.org) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/opattison/jeancflanagan) for more on the development process.
