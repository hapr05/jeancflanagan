    <h1>About</h1>
  </header>
  <p>I’m a science education researcher and writer living in Washington, DC. My research and development focus is on curriculum materials and assessments for K-12 biology education. I’m currently a Research Associate at AAAS Project 2061, where I’ve been for over four years now. I also founded and write for the team blog Sci-Ed on the PLOS network.</p>
  <p>My interests include school-based science education, free-choice science education, science communication, science writing, science and the public, open access and open science, the nature of science, ethics, evolution, ecology, zoology, animal cognition, paleobiology, biodiversity, and conservation. As a liberal arts type, I especially love where science meets the humanities and social sciences.</p>
  <p>I’m somewhat obsessed with science trade books, I subscribe to over 250 RSS feeds and over 700 Twitter feeds, I try to find time for photography, and I like to hang out in museums.</p>
  <p>Views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my employer.</p>
