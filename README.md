# Website for Jean C. Flanagan
## Begun 2013-06-17

This is a collaborative project created by Oliver Pattison and Jean Flanagan. Design, concept and structure are primarily by Oliver, while content is all Jean's. The site is built using (hopefully) modern, standards-compliant HTML and CSS, as a static site using Jekyll.

### Goals

- Static HTML site built using Jekyll
- Semantic, maintainable HTML
- Mobile-first CSS
- Responsive, high performance design
- Typographic-focused design - few images except for photo content

### Content

- Writing index
    - Self-published content
    - Content published elsewhere
- Photography
- About page
