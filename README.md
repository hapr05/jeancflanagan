# Website for Jean C. Flanagan

by Oliver Pattison and Jean Flanagan

This is a collaborative project created by Oliver Pattison and Jean Flanagan. Design, concept and structure are primarily by Oliver, while content is all Jean's. The site is built using (hopefully) modern, standards-compliant HTML and CSS, as a static site using Jekyll.
