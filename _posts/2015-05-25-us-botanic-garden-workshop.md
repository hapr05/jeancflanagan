These were shot at a two-day photography workshop held at the [U.S. Botanic Garden](http://www.usbg.gov/) in Washington, DC. The workshop, lead by [Joshua Taylor](http://www.joshuataylorphotography.com/), included the opportunity to shoot throughout the conservatory early in the morning, before the public were let in. After the workshop, I also used this set as my first foray into editing with [VSCO Film](http://vsco.co/film) film emulations.
