  ## I’m a science educator, writer, and editor from Washington DC.

  I’m passionate about biodiversity, conservation, and high-quality science education in both formal and informal environments.

  In my free time I’m hiking with my rescued hound dog, cycling, traveling, taking photos, and downloading more podcasts than I’ll ever get through.

  **This site is a personal archive for my writing, photography, and other projects.**

  Since 2012 I’ve maintained my own website as a personal archive. It won’t suddenly change its rules, lose my content, or go out of business. If you’re interested, you can read more about the indie web movement.
