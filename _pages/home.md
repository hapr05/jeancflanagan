  - title: Education Standards & Assessment
    expanded: |+
      I’ve developed deep expertise in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and their parent document, the NRC’s *Framework for K-12 Science Education*. I’m also committed to improving the quality of written and performance-based assessments through careful standards alignment.
  - title: Curriculum Development
    expanded: |+
      I focus on developing inquiry/practice-based materials for elementary and middle school science classrooms. I believe high-quality curriculum materials can be educative for both students and teachers.
  - title: Writing & Editing
    expanded: |+
      I write about science, nature, and education for a variety of audiences, including teachers, students, and the general public. As an editor, I specialize in structural and line editing and see myself as an advocate for the reader.
  - title: Research
    expanded: |+
      I’ve served on the research team for multiple federally funded (NSF, IES) science education research studies, collecting and analyzing data, including user interviews on educational products. All my work is informed by a passion for better translating existing research into practice – I spend a lot of time on Google Scholar!
  - title: Project Management
    expanded: |+
      I am often managing multiple collaborative projects. I know my way around Basecamp and Slack, and enjoy looking for ways to streamline processes and foster creativity.
  - title: Photography & Photo Editing
    expanded: |+
      I’ve been a hobbyist photographer for over six years, and I’ve found editing in Lightroom just as engaging as shooting. I’m also comfortable prepping photos for web publication.
