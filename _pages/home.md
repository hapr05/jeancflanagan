  ## I’m a science educator, writer, and editor from Washington DC.

  I’m passionate about biodiversity, conservation, and high-quality science education. My work is at the overlap of an interdisciplinary Venn diagram that includes science, writing and editing, education, research, policy, schools, museums, and educational product development and media production.

  In my free time I’m into hiking, traveling, photography, dog rescue, live music, and keeping up with the latest popular science books, podcasts, documentaries, and web series.

  **This site is a personal archive for my writing, photography, and other projects.**

  I’ve maintained my own website since 2012. It won’t suddenly change its rules, lose my content, or go out of business. If you’re interested, you can read more about the indie web movement.
