  I am committed to the idea that all students should have access to a high-quality science education. I apply expertise in education research, national standards (NGSS), curriculum, assessment, and professional development to provide support, training, and resources to educators striving to raise expectations and meet this challenging, but achievable goal.

details:
  - title: National Standards (NGSS)
    expanded: |+
      I have expertise in the [Next Generation Science Standards](http://www.nextgenscience.org/) (NGSS) and their parent document, the NRC’s [*A Framework for K-12 Science Education*](http://www.nextgenscience.org/framework-k%E2%80%9312-science-education). I was recently selected as a panelist on [Achieve's NGSS EQuIP Peer Review Panel](http://achieve.org/our-initiatives/equip/peer-review-panel).
  - title: Curriculum Development
    expanded: |+
      I focus on developing research-based, standards-aligned materials for elementary and middle school science classrooms. I believe high-quality curriculum materials can be educative for both students and teachers.
  - title: Professional Development & Training
    expanded: |+
      I train educators on understanding and implementing the NGSS, using the [EQuIP rubric](http://www.nextgenscience.org/sites/default/files/EQuIP%20Rubric%20for%20Science%20v3.pdf) to identify NGSS-aligned materials, anticipating and probing student ideas, and facilitating student engagement in the science & engineering practices.
  - title: Assessment
    expanded: |+
      I develop high-quality written- and performance-based assessments through careful review, pilot testing, and precise standards alignment.
  - title: Writing & Editing
    expanded: |+
      I [write](/writing/) about science, nature, and education for a variety of audiences, including teachers, students, and the general public. As an editor, I specialize in structural and line editing and especially enjoy opportunities for close collaboration with writers.
  - title: Research
    expanded: |+
      I’ve served on the research team for multiple federally funded (NSF, IES) science education research studies collecting and analyzing data, including user interviews. I also specialize in translating research findings into the design of educational products – I spend a lot of time on Google Scholar.
  - title: Project Management
    expanded: |+
      I am often managing multiple collaborative projects. I know my way around Basecamp and Slack, and am always looking for ways to streamline processes and foster creativity.
  - title: Photography & Photo Editing
    expanded: |+
      I’ve been a hobbyist photographer for over six years, and find editing in Lightroom just as engaging as shooting. I also shoot events for charities like [City Dogs Rescue](http://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/).
