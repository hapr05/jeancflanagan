<div class="introduction">
  <p>I'm interested in pushing science education and communication forward by getting research out of the ivory tower and into practice. I've immersed myself in education research and national standards for AAAS, PLOS, and Smithsonian, focusing on the development of curriculum, assessments, and professional development. This site is a personal archive of my writing, photography, and other projects. <a href="/about/">Find out more about me.</a></p>
